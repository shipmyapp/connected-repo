 *   normal team-management routes; the client updates `activeTeamId`
 *   from the profile-page team switcher.
 *
 * Wave-1 anchor mints `topLevelSyncedAt` server-side; every downstream
 * pull echoes it back so the whole cycle sees a consistent snapshot
 * ceiling. Cursors are per-team so switching between teams doesn't
 * collide.
 *
 * Two operations, two trigger models:
 *
 *   `processQueue()` — full cycle (pull + push + upload). THROTTLED
 *   to `THROTTLE_WINDOW_MS`. Triggers:
 *     - visibilitychange / focus / online events
 *     - Silent-sync FCM push → SW postMessage
 *     - 2-minute main-thread interval (visibility-gated)
 *     - 2-minute worker-realm safety-net interval
 *     - User-forced (`force: true`): Sync-now button, per-row Retry
 *
 *   `drainLocalChanges()` — event-driven push + upload only. NOT
 *   throttled. Triggers:
 *     - `subscribe()` DB-write callback on external `files` writes —
 *       fires the upload worker as soon as a blob is staged.
 *     - Browser `online` event — sends offline-created entries + CDN
 *       updates the moment the network returns.
 *     - After a file upload completes — kicks pushCdnUpdates so the
 *       fresh URL is atomic with the upload.
 *
 * External `journalEntries` writes are handled by `createOnlineFirst`
 * itself (online RPC direct or savedOffline queued). They do NOT
 * trigger `drainLocalChanges` — that would race the in-flight direct
 * create RPC and double-send the row.

	//   Both run INLINE inside `runCycle` while holding `isProcessing`, so no
